                        The trader’s journey can lead you down one of two paths: the trading merry go around failure that is often 
                        the route new traders take, and the path to successful trading. How can you get on the preferred route to day 
                        trading success?</br>
                        In this webinar we will detail why most intraday trading strategies fail, the critical errors most traders make 
                        and discuss pointers for successful day trading.

                                <p>
                                    Adam Harris transitioned to trading the financial markets in 2008, after he sold his successful 
                                    post-production film company and moved to London from South Africa.  This previous career in visual 
                                    effects provided him with a solid foundation for technical software, and skills requiring both 
                                    artistic and scientific approaches.
                                    Adam’s change of career led him to focus on trading as it solved several personal needs - the 
                                    ability to work from anywhere in the world, provided no income ceiling, and was largely recession 
                                    proof. His re-education covered several programs in London, progressing to trading his own capital 
                                    and finally to include client funds. Adam applies a blend of both traditional, discretionary trading 
                                    as well as algorithmic strategies. 
                                </p>

                                    As trading regulated funds only occupies a small portion of Adam’s daily life, he also provides 
                                    technical analysis content through Trade With Precision for a select few institutions globally, 
                                    such as the Futures Institute division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (C.M.E.), 
                                    the Intercontinental Exchange (I.C.E.),  and mentors a limited number of individuals each year. He 
                                    attributes his success to taking advantage of opportunities across different asset classes including, 
                                    Stocks, Currencies, Commodities, Bonds and Indices. Adam looks forward to bringing his real-world 
                                    trading experience, technical analysis expertise and unique mentoring techniques to an exclusive 
                                    client base.
